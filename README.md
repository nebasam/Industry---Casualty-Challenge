# Industry---Casualty-Challenge
> 
A common frustration in the industry, especially when it comes to getting business insights from tabular data, is that the most interesting questions (from their perspective) are often not answerable with observational data alone.
These questions can be similar to:
“What will happen if I halve the price of my product?”
“Which clients will pay their debts only if I call them?”
This project tries to deal with this kind of question using causal graph.

# Description
> **Breast-cancer Diagnostic** Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer death in women after lung cancer. Advances in screening and treatment for breast cancer have improved survival rates dramatically since 1989. According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), there are more than 3.1 million breast cancer survivors in the United States. The chance of any woman dying from breast cancer is around 1 in 38 (2.6%). A breast cancer victims chances for long term survival are improved by early detection of the disease and early detection is in turn enhanced by an accurate diagnosis. The choice of appropriate treatments immediately following surgery is largely
influenced by prognosis that is the expected long term behavior of the disease.

# Project Structure

# Data Source Used:
- https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/

# Installation requirements

>
The python packages required to do the project are listed in the requiremnt.txt file and can be easily installed by running the setup.py Python file.
>
# scripts
>
Different scripts used for Eda and feature selection are found here in this folder
> 
# notebook
